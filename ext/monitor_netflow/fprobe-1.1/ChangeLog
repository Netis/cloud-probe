	* Release 1.1: bugfixes, features enhancement.

	* Changes:
	- was fixed vulnerability to a DoS attack, as described in "Denial
          of Service via Algorithmic Complexity Attacks" by Scott A
          Crosby and Dan S Wallach: http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash,
	  by strengthening the crc16 hash function implementation;
	  note that xor8 and xor16 hashes remain vulnerable
	- default hash was changed to crc16
	- -B option was added

	* Release 1.0.5: minor bugfixes, features enhancement.

	* Release 1.0.4: minor bugfixes, features enhancement.

	* Changes:
	- Fixed trailer bug for hardware with limitation of the minimal
	  size of a frame. This error was appearing as incorrect size
	  calculation for tiny packets. For example (for ethernet
	  hardware) length of TCP ACK packet is usually 40 bytes, but
	  because of frame trailer it would be counted as 46 bytes.
	- Fixed minor bug in "uptime trick" mechanism.
	- Added ability to process files produced by tcpdump -w.
	- Now fprobe creates pidfiles.
	- TCP flags support was extended for CWR and ECE flags.

	- Fixed inexact code in find().
	- New option -k.
	- Removed option -z.
	- New data link layer types.

	- Fixed unfortunate misprint in --with-pcap handling.
	- Fixed bug in "uptime trick" mechanism after receiving SIGTERM.

	  (e.g. interface shut down).
	- Added scrip contrib/redhat-init.d:
	  Placed in /etc/rc.d/init.d/fprobe on linux, it can be controlled
	  with chkconfig (on systems that use it).
	  Thanks to Daniel Senie <dts@senie.com>

2003-01-07  Slava Astashonok <sla@0n.ru>

	* Release 1.0.pre1:
	- New features, minor fixes.

	* Changes:
	- Daemonize done. The default behaviour of fprobe now is run
	  in background. Note that if log destination contains `stdout'
	  (equal 2 or 3) fprobe will run in foreground.
	- Default log destination changed to syslog.
	- Now fprobe catch SIGTERM signal and emit flows cache before exit.
	- Changed --enable-debug arguments. Now valid arguments are
	  C, U, S, E, M, F and I. Example: --enable-debug="C M I E" -
	  enable Capture, Memory, Info and Emit debug messages.
	  "I"-debug information accessible via SIGUSR1 signal.
	  Note that SIGUSR1 will cause program termination if it
	  compiled without --enable-debug="I".
	- Manpage updates.

2002-12-19  Slava Astashonok <sla@0n.ru>

	* Release 0.91:

	- Fixed snmp_index typo, sorry.
	- Fixed potential flaw with non-realtime scheduling.

	* Misc:
	- New options:
	  -a Now possible to specify source address for NetFlow flow.
	  -t Emitting rate limit. Used relatively silly way.

	- At last added TCP flags field support.
	- Added RPM specfile.
	- Manpage updates.

2002-12-09  Slava Astashonok <sla@0n.ru>

	* Release 0.90.1:
	- Typo in usage() information

2002-12-08  Slava Astashonok <sla@0n.ru>

	* Release 0.90:
	- The main goal of this release is perfomance improvement.
	  Almost all was rewrited from this point of view.
	- It seems version 1.0 it is not far, so I made big jump in
	  version enumeration.

	* Perfomance fixes:
	- Hash size expanded from 8 to 16 bits.
	- New fast and efficient memory subsystem.
	- Realtime scheduling.

	* Bugfixes, portability fixes:
	- Correct ctime updating after packet "reassembling".
	- NETFLOW_SRC_AS_SIZE and NETFLOW_DST_AS_SIZE in netflow.h was wrong.
	  Previous versions unaffected to this bug.
	- Handling RedHad's pcap.h location.

	* Misc:
	- Changed -e option sense - now it equivalent to Cisco's active timer.
	- Added new hash types: xor16 and crc16.
	- New options:
	  -x Workaround for SNMP interface index
	  -b Memory bulk size in flow entries
	  -m Memory limit in kilobytes
	  -q Pending queue length in flow entries
	  -r Realtime priority
	- New compiling options:
	  --with-pcap=<path> Example: /usr/local/pcap/include
	  --with-libpcap=<path> Example: /usr/local/pcap/lib
	  --with-membulk=<mode> ptr - less efficient, but fastest
	  --with-hash=<type> crc16 - slowest, but smooth
	  --enable-messages Enable runtime error and warning messages
	- Added simple script for stress tests: contrib/tg.sh
	- Manpage updates.

2002-11-08  Slava Astashonok <sla@0n.ru>

	* Release 0.9:

	- New option -z for timezone correction
	- New data link layer types: DLT_IP_OVER_FC and DLT_SUNATM
	- New options in configure script:
	  --enable-uptime_trick: this option may used to solve potential
	  uptime wraparound bug in NetFlow collectors
	  --enable-icmp_trick: if this option enabled fprobe will
	  store ICMP type and code in srcport and dstport fields
	- Manpage updates

2002-10-25  Slava Astashonok <sla@0n.ru>

	* Release 0.8 (first public release):
	- NetFlow 1, 5 and 7 partially supported:
	  supported fields in header record: version, count, SysUptime,
	  unix_secs, unix_nsecs, flow_sequence
	  in flow record: srcaddr, dstaddr, dPkts, dOctets, First,
	  Last, srcport, dstport
	- Compiled on Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris (all x86)
	- Seems work, but not properly tested
