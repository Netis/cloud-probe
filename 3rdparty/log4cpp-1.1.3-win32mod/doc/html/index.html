<h2>What is log4cpp?</h2>
</a>
<p>Log4cpp is library of C++ classes for flexible logging to
files, syslog, IDSA and other destinations.
It is modeled after the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j">Log4j</a>
Java library, staying as close to their API as is reasonable.

<h2>Download</h2>
</a>
<p>Sources are available from SourceForges <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15190">download
page</a>.<br>
We do not supply binaries, because of the numerous incompatible ABIs
(e.g. g++ 2.95 vs 2.96 vs 3.0 vs 3.2) and different package
formats.<br>
A stable but older version of log4cpp is available in Debian stable,
see <a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/libs/">http://packages.debian.org/stable/libs/</a>.<br>
FreeBSD users can find log4cpp in the ports collection,
see <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/devel.html">http://www.freebsd.org/ports/devel.html</a><br>
Log4cpp includes support for building RPMs, so building your own from
the source tar-ball is as simple as
</p>
<pre class="code">rpm -ta log4cpp-x.y.z.tar.gz<br></pre>
<p></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="building">Building Log4cpp</a></h2>
<h3><a id="buildlinux">Autoconf</a></h3>
<p>As of version 0.2.0 log4cpp can be build using autoconf on
platforms
that support it. Simply do:
</p>
<pre class="code">./configure<br>make<br>make check<br>make install<br></pre>
<p>This will install log4cpp under /usr/local. To install in
another localation specify --prefix=&lt;location&gt; when
running configure.
</p>
<h3>Options for ./configure</h3>
Besides the usual ./configure options like --prefix a few others are
available:
<dl>
<dt>--with-idsa</dt>
<dd>Include support for logging to IDSA (<a href="http://jade.cs.uct.ac.za/idsa/index.html">http://jade.cs.uct.ac.za/idsa/index.html</a>).
This will give you an IdsaAppender Appender class.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>--with-omnithreads[=&lt;path-to-omniORB&gt;]</dt>
<dd>Enable multi-threading support using omniORB4's omniThreads
MT abstraction library (http://www.omniorb.org).
configure expects the omnithread header files to reside in
&lt;path-to-omniORB&gt;/include and the library in
&lt;path-to-omniORB&lt;/lib, i.e. not in a platform specific
subdirectory. Create symlinks where necessary.<br>
NB. omniORB4 is required: omniORB3 will not suffice as it lacks
sufficient support for thread specific data.
At the moment (August 2002) omniORB4 is in beta, however most parts and
specifically the threading
library appear to be quite stable.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>--with-pthreads</dt>
<dd>Enable multi-threading support using the 'pthread' POSIX
threads library.
This option is mutually exclusive with --with-omnithreads.</dd>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>--enable-doxyen</dt>
<dd>Enables generation of API documentation by Dimitri van
Heeschs Doxygen tool
(http://www.doxygen.org/). Defaults to yes if doxygen can be found in
the
search path.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>--enable-html-docs</dt>
<dd>If doxygen is enabled, have it generate HTML formatted
documentation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>--enable-latex-docs</dt>
<dd>If doxygen is enabled, have it generate LaTeX formatted
documentation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt> --enable-dot</dt>
<dd>Let Doxygen use the 'dot' tool of GraphViz (<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">http://www.graphviz.org</a>)
todraw its graphs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>--disable-remote-syslog </dt>
<dd>Exclude RemoteSyslogAppender from build (included by default)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>--disable-smtp</dt>
<dd>Exclude SmtpAppender from build (included by default)</dd>
</dl>

<p></p>
<h3>Build notes for specific platforms</h3>
<dl>
<dt>*nix - g++ compiler</dt>
<dd>Log4cpp should build whitout modification on any decent
*nix system with g++ and GNU make. The primary development platform is
RedHat Linux 7.3, which has g++ 2.96-rh, but the aim is to be
compatible with from g++ 2.95 and up. When g++ 3.x has been widely
adopted we may drop support for older g++ versions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Solaris - Sun CC compiler</dt>
<dd>Compilation with Suns CC compiler requires setting some
enviroment variables.
Also static libraries appear not to work. In short do:
<pre class="code">CC=CC CXX=CC LD="CC -KPIC" ./configure --disable-static<br></pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><a id="buildwindows">Win32 - VS2010</a></dt>
<dd>Use the workspace and project files in subdirectory msvc10.
(You may need to adjust include/log4cpp/config-win32.h and the project
files to your particular needs)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Win32 - MSVC++ 6</dt>
<dd>Use the workspace and project files in subdirectory msvc6.
You may need to adjust include/log4cpp/config-win32.h and the project
files to your particular needs.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>Win32 - MSVC++ 5</dt>
<dd>Building log4cpp with MSVC++ 5 is not supported and will
not be,
unless someone can find a way to do so without mutilating the source
code.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Win32 - Borland C++ Builder 5</dt>
<dd>Use the project and make files in subdirectory bcb5.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Win32 - Cygwin</dt>
<dd>Use './configure; make; make install'.<br>
Be warned that there have been very few success or failure reports for
this platform,
so either it works very smoothly or noone actively uses log4cpp with
Cygwin :-)
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>OpenVMS</dt>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Edit include/log4cpp/config-openvms.h if you need
different settings.<br>
This has been tested on OpenVMS Alpha v7.3 and Compaq C++ V6.3-020
only.
</dd>
<dd>1) Copy the src and include directory (including all its
contents and subdirectories) onto your OpenVMS system.</dd>
<dd>2) Compile each source file (*.CPP and *.C in the src
directory) one by one by the following command,
<pre class="code">cxx /include=("/a1\$dkb0/user/tony/project/log4cpp/include") /define=(__USE_STD_IOSTREAM,__OPENVMS__) /repository=a1$dkb0:[user.tony.project.log4cpp.repository] APPENDER.CPP<br>cxx /include=("/a1\$dkb0/user/tony/project/log4cpp/include") /define=(__USE_STD_IOSTREAM,__OPENVMS__) /repository=a1$dkb0:[user.tony.project.log4cpp.repository] APPENDERSKELETON.CPP<br></pre>
...etc<br>
Please substitute a correct path for your include directory. A
unix-style directory name is requied in the /include parameter.
In this example, the pathis A1$DKBO:[USER.TONY.PROJECT.LOG4CPP.INCLUDE]<br>
A repository directory is also specified here as
A1$DKB0:[USER.TONY.PROJECT.LOG4CPP.REPOSITORY].<br>
</dd>
<dd>3) Create a static library, LOG4CPP.OLB
<pre class="code">lib/create log4cpp<br></pre>
</dd>
<dd>4) Put all compiled OBJ files into the LOG4CPP.OLB
<pre class="code">lib/insert log4cpp appender<br>lib/insert log4cpp appenderskeleton<br></pre>
...etc<br>
</dd>
<dd>5) Link a program with log4cpp.olb. e.g:
<pre class="code">cxx /include=("/a1\$dkb0/user/tony/project/log4cpp/include") /define=(__USE_STD_IOSTREAM,__OPENVMS__) testlog4cpp.cxx<br>cxxlink /repository=a1$dkb0:[user.tony.project.log4cpp.repository] testlog4cpp,log4cpp/library<br></pre>

<h2><a id="faq">FAQ</a></h2>
<h3>1. GENERAL</h3>
<h4>1.1. What is Log for C++?</h4>
Log for C++ is a library of C++ classes for flexible logging to files,
syslog and other destinations. It is modeled after the Log for Java
library (http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/), staying as close to their
API as is reasonable.
<h4>1.2. How is Log for C++ related to Log4j? Is it a straight
port?</h4>
Log for C++ strives to supply a similar interface for logging in C++ as
Log4j provides in Java. However the implementation is not a
translation of the Java code. So in that sense it is not a 'port' of
Log4j. Of course Log for C++ does owe many of its concepts to log4j.
<h4>1.3. What is the name of this project, 'Log for C++' or
'log4cpp'?</h4>
The 'official' long name of the project is 'Log for C++', but in
practice, the short name, 'log4cpp' has proven more convinient.
<h4>1.4. Under which license is Log for C++ available?</h4>
As of version 0.2.1 Log for C++ is released under the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL).
Versions before that have been released under the GPL. See the license
discussion on the forum at SourceForge
for the motivations behind switching from GPL to LGPL.
<h4>1.5. Our legal department doesn't like the LGPL, can you
release Log for C++ under license XYZ?</h4>
No.<br>
Long answer: Technically it may be possible if every contributor
agrees,
which due to their growing number has become increasingly
difficult. But even if that could be overcome it will not happen.<br>
Of course the LGPL does grant you the opportunity to choose the GPL
instead of the LGPL, but I bet XYZ != GPL.
<h3>2. COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION</h3>
See <a href="#building">building</a><br>
<h3>3. USAGE</h3>
<h4>3.1. I've succesfully compiled log4cpp, now how do I use this
stuff?</h4>
Have a glance at <a title="Simple example" href="#simpleexample">Simple
example</a> and <a title="Properties file example" href="#propfile">Properties file example</a>.
For some small examples using log4cpp, see the 'tests' subdirectory.
Also see the documentation section for a pointer for API documentation
and more usage information. 
<h4>3.2. Is log4cpp thread-safe?</h4>
The same instance of the log4cpp::Category object (a logger) can be used from different threads simultaneously without explicit synchronization. Concurrent access to the appenders will be prevented by the logger object itself. It will lock internal mutex each time when it comes to writing into appenders. So, it is safe, for example, to write from the multiple threads to the same logger which appends to the same file.
Although, log4cpp is configured in such a way that two different loggers append to the same appender (it may be a file), then there will be no way for the logging framework to arrange proper addition and things can get mixed up. So this way of configuration is not recommended.
<h4>3.3. What are possible format characters for the custom log message?</h4>
PatternLayout supports following set of format characters:<br>
<li><b>%%</b> - a single percent sign</li>
<li><b>%c</b> - the category</li>
<li><b>%d</b> - the date\n
 Date format: The date format character may be followed by a date format
 specifier enclosed between braces. For example, %d{%H:%M:%S,%l} or %d{%d %m %Y %H:%M:%S,%l}.
 If no date format specifier is given then the following format is used:
"Wed Jan 02 02:03:55 1980". The date format specifier admits the same syntax
as the ANSI C function strftime, with 1 addition. The addition is the specifier
%l for milliseconds, padded with zeros to make 3 digits.</li>
      <li><b>%m</b> - the message</li>
      <li><b>%n</b> - the platform specific line separator</li>
      <li><b>%p</b> - the priority</li>
      <li><b>%r</b> - milliseconds since this layout was created.</li>
      <li><b>%R</b> - seconds since Jan 1, 1970</li>
      <li><b>%u</b> - clock ticks since process start</li>
      <li><b>%x</b> - the NDC</li>
      <li><b>%t</b> - thread name</li>
      
      By default, ConversionPattern for PatternLayout is set to "%m%n".<br>
<h3>4. PROBLEMS AND ERROR MESSAGES</h3>
<h4>4.1. I get 'Naming collision for 'ERROR' detected. Please
read the FAQ for a workaround.'</h4>
This is caused by the rudeness of some platforms, which mutilate the
namespace with some blunt #defines. To be more precise,
the Win32 API includes #defines of 'ERROR' and 'DEBUG'. Since the
preprocessor is unaware of C++ naming scopes this results in
reserving the words ERROR and DEBUG litterally everywhere. In
particular this conflicts with log4cpp::Prioritiy::ERROR and
log4cpp::Priority::DEBUG. These latter two names come from log4j, so
they are not something we made up ourselves.<br>
They Win32 authors should not have rudelessly claimed these generic
names through the preprocessor. There are much better alternatives:
<ol>
<li>If they use it as an integer constant, declare it using a
language construct.
Either '<tt>enum {ERROR=1};</tt>' or '<tt>static
const int ERROR=1;</tt>' would do fine.</li>
<li>Use a less generic name like WIN32API_ERROR to make naming
conflicts less likely</li>
<li>In case they use it as a flag for conditional compilation,
use '<tt>#define DEBUG DEBUG</tt>' and '<tt>#if
defined(DEBUG)</tt>'.
In that case the preprocessor would simply replace all occurrences of
'DEBUG' in the source code with 'DEBUG', in effect leaving
everything intact.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course the proper solution would be if the offending party
would use one of the above methods, but we could have to wait
some time for this to actually happen. As an alternative log4cpp can
workaround these #defines. The workaround code is enabled by
doing <tt>#define LOG4CPP_FIX_ERROR_COLLISION 1</tt>
before #including any log4cpp header files and after #including all
platform headers. For Win32 platforms this #define has already been
included in log4cpp/config-win32.h.
</p>
<p>Once log4cpp has been updated to the log4j 1.2 API we can get
rid of this problem by adopting the new names for log levels.
</p>
<h4>4.2. I am trying to compile/link the log4cpp package using
the SunWorkshop compiler (CC) on a Solaris 7 machine.
The library builds, but the testmain code fails to link properly.</h4>
A proper solution for this problem has not been found yet (suggestions
are welcome),
but James Emery reported success with the following workaround:
<ul>
<li>Disable building of the static library</li>
<li>Change the linker from /usr/ucb/ld to CC and enable 'place
independent code' (pic).</li>
</ul>
In short, configure with:<br>
<pre class="code">export LD="CC -Kpic" &amp;&amp; ./configure --disable-static</pre>
<h4>4.3. ./configure fails to detect 'snprintf()' on platform XYZ.</h4>
./configure does not just check for the presence of a snprintf()
function but for C99 compliancy as well. In particular, snprintf()
should strictly honour the 'string size' parameter to avoid potential
buffer overflow problems.
log4cpp falls back to an <a href="http://www.ijs.si/software/snprintf/">alternative
snprintf() implementation</a> if the OS does not provide a
correct one.

Descendant sub1 writes into two files, filtering output by message priority for second of them. Descendant sub1.sub2 writes also into rolling file. 
Log file A3.log is rolled over as soon as it reaches limit of 200 bytes, 1 backup log file is kept.

<h2><a id="git">Git Repository</a></h2>
<p>
log4cpp is moved to git <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/log4cpp/codegit/">SourceForge Git page</a> since version 1.1.1, cvs is stale now.
</p>
<p>Log4cpp of older versions is also available through CVS, see the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/log4cpp/code/">SourceForge CVS page</a> for instructions.</p>
<small>
CVS had two branches:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>MAIN</td><td>for log4cpp development</td></tr>
<tr><td>BRANCH_MAINT_0_2</td><td>for maintainance of log4cpp-stable (0.2.x)</td></tr>
</tbody></table><br>
</small>
Each release will receive a tag named REL_x_y_z.
<p></p>
<p>To start working with a freshly checked out log4cpp revision, run <b>./autogen.sh</b>
 first. This will create ./configure and the necessary Makefile.in's. 
You'll need at least autoconf 2.50, automake 1.6.0 and libtool 1.4.

<h2><a id="status">Status</a></h2>
<p>The latest stable release is 1.1.2</p>
<small>
<p>log4cpp is moved to git since version 1.1.1, cvs is stale since then</p>
<p>As of version 0.3.0 log4cpp has a separate 'stable' and 'development' branches.
Releases x.y.z where y is even are considered stable and those where y is odd are experimental
(which means that some or all features may be broken).</p>
<p>Releases of 0.2.x are for bug 
fixes only, new features will go into 0.3.x and eventually 0.4.x.</p> </small>
