TODO

This file contains an imcomplete list of things to be done, not necessarily
ordered by importance or urgence.


Add provisional category nodes. Maybe work it out a bit differently than
LOG4J. First actually document what the exact behaviour should be.

Add a simple configurator of type 'keyword=value'. Done: 0.2.6

Port PatternLayout. Done: 0.2.6

Document multithreading policy and behaviour (i.e. all log calls are thread 
safe, others are 'mulithread prepared').

Add multithread support for the NDC class.

Add switches to configure to tune document generation (e.g. --with-latex, etc). Done: 0.2.3

Move stuff from Hints to autconf. E.g. LOG4CPP_USE_OLD_IOSTREAM. Done: 0.2.3

Document all classes.

Add more tests.
